# CppHeaders Reflection Library

## TODOs

- [ ] Implement primitive adapters
- [ ] Implement user type factory
- [ ] Design inheritance
    - Since initialization order of static object is not guaranteed, object expansion may not be handled correctly. Thus
      to make them work as expected, kind of deferred evaluation of property factory will be required ... (idea: defer
      until initialized?)
